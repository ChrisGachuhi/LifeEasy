1. Backend Infrastructure First
 Order.js schema - Ensure it includes paymentMethod, isPaid, etc.

 routes/order.js - Accept payment method & record order

 routes/payment.js - Placeholder route for MPESA logic

2. Redux Setup (Frontend State Management)
 mpesaApi.js - To hit /api/mpesa/stk

 orderSlice.js - Maintain order + payment status

 store.js - Add the new slices and APIs

3. UI/UX Checkout Flow
 Checkout.jsx:

Validate form

Call placeOrder from orderApi

If paymentMethod === "mpesa", hit mpesaApi

Show “Waiting for payment...” feedback

4. Final Step: Live MPESA STK Push Logic
Reuse your working initiateStkPush logic

Integrate the frontend trigger via Redux (or axios in some cases)
